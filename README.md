### Determinants of wages

In this project, I examined factors that determined the wages of employees leveraging Tableau. The sample is a cross-section data originating from the March 1988 Current Population Survey by the US Census Bureau.

Features such as 'years of experience', 'ethnicity', 'occupation type', 'manufacturing industry membership' were considered.

Findings revealed:
-minimum wage of $292 and maximum wage of $5100
-employees in the white_collar sector earned more, which is in tandem with real world practices in ideal situations
-People with 30 to 40 years of experience earned more
-African-Americans earned lower wages compared to other ethnicities
-The male gender earned more than their female counterparts
-Workers in non-manufacturing industry earned more, in contrast to employees of manufacturing sector
